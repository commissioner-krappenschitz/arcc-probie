# Probationary Status

* Probationary status is one (1) month minimum and three (3) months maximum _(depending on the times of OPs rendered)_ period of membership where supervisors and department administration will follow your performance within the group and assists you as needed.
* During this time, you may be contacted with regards to mistakes you have made while conducting duties and should take actions to correct and learn from those mistakes.
* Probationary members who show an inability to learn from their mistakes will be removed from the group. This is a last resort and every effort will be made to assist the probationary before this step is reached.
* Probationary members will be allowed to test out their status after three (3) months. Probationary members must pass the exam with an 85 rate if they want to progress.
* In order to test out, probationary members must post their availability by requesting one through the Google Form provided in the main SOP. You are responsible to take this step.
