Welcome to the Allied Responders and Communicators of Cebu, Inc.<mark style="color:orange;">!</mark>&#x20;

Congratulations on completion of your application to the <mark style="color:orange;">Allied Responders and Communicators of Cebu, Inc.!</mark> You are now a probationary member of the group and will be monitored for the entirety of your probationary period. Your appointment as a probationary member of the group is not permanent.

* During this time it is expected that you will not have the answers for every situation you encounter, because of this inexperience we ask that you request any assistance to any senior/supervisors of Field Training Officers (FTOs) as often as possible when conducting duties as a volunteer fire/medical personnel. If those individuals are unavailable, simply request to ride along with any member or above. Completing the requirements/checklist to join/participate any group-related events are required during your probationary status to help you learn and grow safely during your probationary period. You may still conduct your duties alone.
* You will be expected to be in compliance with all policies and procedures set forth in the ARCC SOP and its documents within. There are numerous complex policies within the ARCC SOP and any questions should be directed to any FTO or supervisors for assistance.
* Your callsign is up to you and will be recorded as official in the group once you have submitted one.&#x20;
* Remember that from this point on you are responsible for your own actions, but if you need assistanceâ€”a supervisor/senior will answer any question you may have. You will be expected to be familiar with the ARCC's Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).
